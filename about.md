Our team, _The Crescent Wrenches_ ðŸš—, consists of a 11 now-Juniors attending Eden Prairie High School.
We represent the first Shell Eco-marathon from Eden Prairie. This competition is
dominated by colleges, so our team is required to be highly rigorous and hard-working.
Our car will debut near March 2019 in the Shell Eco-marathon Urban Concept Competition in California.
Once finished, our car will have been the product of nearly 1.5 years of work.
